# My "Decade" With Go

This talk is about **MY** experiences with Go. Hence, everything is highly opinionated and all suggestions are just that: suggestions. It is fine if you disagree and it is fine if you have other experiences than me.

You can find the slides of the talk in [Symflower - My Decade With Go.pdf](Symflower%20-%20My%20Decade%20With%20Go.pdf).
