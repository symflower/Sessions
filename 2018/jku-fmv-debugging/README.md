# Fantastic Bugs ... and Where to Find Them

This talk was held during the [JKU's FMV](http://fmv.jku.at/) lecture ["Debugging" in the 2018/19WS semester](http://fmv.jku.at/dbg/index.html). The talk gave a basic overview about software testing and debugging, what the problems are and what suggested solutions are. In a nutshell, software testing and finding bugs is hard.
