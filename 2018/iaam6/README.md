# Introducing Go (Golang) - Answering "WHY" you should use Go

We held this talk ad-hoc at the [6th IaaM gathering](https://www.meetup.com/iaam-linz/events/254402943/). The slides can be found in [Introducing Go (Golang).pdf](./Introducing Go \(Golang\).pdf). If you are interested in learning how to program in Go, this talk is not for you (but you should have a look at [The Go Tour](https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1)). This talk is about WHY you should be interested in using Go and the reasons why we use Go at [Symflower](https://symflower.com).
