# Magic-like Unit Testing

This talk is about different techniques of generating unit tests automatically. So if you do not want to write unit tests manually, want to extend your test suite automatically with every change and crash all your bugs, you should defintely take a look. The talk discusses three techniques: "Boundary Value Analysis", "Fuzzing" and "Symbolic Execution". The later, symbolic execution, is the gold standard of generating deterministic unit tests with the highest possible coverage and the reason why we employ this technique for [Symflower](https://symflower.com).

You can find the slides of the talk in [2020-03-19 Symflower - Magic-like Unit Testing.pdf](2020-03-19%20Symflower%20-%20Magic-like%20Unit%20Testing.pdf).
